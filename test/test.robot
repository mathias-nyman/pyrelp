*** Test Cases ***
Reference C sender can send a RELP message
    Given an rsyslog receiver is running
    When the reference C sender sends a message
    Then the relp receiver receives the message

Reference C receiver can receive a RELP message
    Given the reference C receiver is running
    When the reference C sender sends a message
    Then the relp receiver receives the message

Pyrelp can be installed and send a RELP message
    Given an rsyslog receiver is running
    When pyrelp is installed on a clean machine
    And the pyrelp client sends a message
    Then the relp receiver receives the message
